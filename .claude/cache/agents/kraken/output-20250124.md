## Key CRO Principles Applied

1. **Transformation Focus:** Headlines and copy emphasize the transformation ("shy kids become team players") rather than features
2. **Risk Reversal:** Multiple mentions of "no commitment", "full refund", "cancel anytime"
3. **Social Proof:** Enhanced testimonials with specific timeframes and transformation badges
4. **Urgency:** Added "limited spots" messaging where appropriate
5. **Parent Benefits:** Copy addresses parent concerns (childcare, safety, work schedules) not just child benefits
6. **Specificity:** Replaced generic claims with specific numbers ("8 kids max", "90% games", "15+ years experience")
7. **Objection Handling:** FAQ addresses common hesitations before they become blockers
