  - task: Analyzed existing codebase structure
    files: []

blockers: []

questions: []

decisions:
  - aggressive_resource_allocation: Large sprint with 13 tasks requires parallel execution where possible
  - sprint_order: Session enhancements first (1-5), then email system (6-10), then testing (11-13)

findings:
  - session_api_location: src/app/api/admin/sessions/route.ts handles POST
  - public_sessions_api: src/app/api/sessions/route.ts calculates availability with hardcoded threshold of 3
  - email_system: src/lib/email.ts uses Resend API directly via fetch
  - existing_session_fields: dayOfWeek (single), no lowStockThreshold, no isForceClosed

worked:
  - tldr commands for token-efficient code exploration
  - plan-agent for comprehensive planning

failed: []

next:
  - Sprint 1 Task #2: Add Firebase write verification with success toasts
  - Sprint 1 Task #3: Add lowStockThreshold field
  - Sprint 1 Task #4: Add isForceClosed toggle
  - Sprint 1 Task #6: Clear action labels
  - Sprint 1 Task #5: Date range with day selection
